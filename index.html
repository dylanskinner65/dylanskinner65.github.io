<!-- <div id="typer"><h1><span class="iq-font-purple">Machine</span> Learning</h1> </div> -->
<p class="lead" style="font-weight:400;" >I am a computational mathematician that specializes in machine learning. I was advised by <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=zCdh4NEAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao" >David Wingate</a> during my undergrad and master's programs, after which I joined OpenAI as a fellow. I spent some time as a research intern at Google Brain working with <a href="https://q-berthet.github.io/">Quentin Berthet</a> on applications of differentiable programming to self supervised learning on audio.
<!-- My previous work was in geometric deep learning using the Wasserstein distance and graph processing to improve <a href="/Masters_Thesis.pdf" >Neural Processes</a>. -->
I'm broadly interested in optimal transport, program synthesis, generative modeling, and theory of machine learning. Feel free to follow me on <a href="https://twitter.com/andrew_n_carr">twitter</a> for random musings about math / deep learning /  programming but mostly memes.

              <p>We were tasked to build a social conversational agent for Alexa that could carry on a 20 minute conversation about arbitrary topics</p>
              <p>This problem is still unsolved and research is ongoing.</p>
              <p>I built offensive speech filtering tools that beat Amazon's internal tools. I also designed a complex sentiment analysis tool that operated as a heuristic for knowledge retrieval from the web</p>

              <p>I made a few web sites for local businesses in the area and for the firm itself. It was an extremely formative time of self study.</p>
