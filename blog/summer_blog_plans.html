                        <p>- Earl Nightingale</p>
                        <h4>Why I Wanted to Write This Article</h4>
                        <p> Over the past few years I have spent a lot of time listening to postcasts, reading LinkedIn posts, and watching
                            videos from successful and influential people in Data Science. These are people like
                            <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/keremenko/?originalSubdomain=au">Kirill Eremenko</a>, 
                            <a href="https://karpathy.ai/">Andrej Karpathy</a>, and <a href="https://lexfridman.com/">Lex Fridman</a>, just to name a few.
                            The biggest thing I have learned from these data science leaders is their ability to post interesting content. Now,
                            these three men are VERY intelligent and are on a completely different plane from myself. However,
                            I feel that one way I can emulate them is by posting what I am learning and working on. I have tried doing that so far,
                            but my blog posts have been few and far between on random topics that I found interesting in school. I am not saying that is
                            a bad thing, but I want to do more.</p>
                        
                        <h4>My Plan</h4>
                        <p>I feel that part of the 'problem' with my infrequent blog posts is I am afraid to put anything out there unless I feel very confident
                            that everything is right and I have had some professional (usually a professor) verify what I am saying. That is something I want to break.
                            This summer, I want to write about the things I am learning. That is all. I want to write about what I am reading, practicing,
                            building, and failing at. I do not want these writings to necessary be tutorials or guides (though I hope some are), but rather
                            my thought process and the things I experience.</p>
                        <p>For example, this summer I want to learn more about data engineering. I want to learn things about databases (both building and querying),
                            data collection and aquisition, data processing and cleaning, etc. I have frequently heard (and I am sure you have too) about how
                            80% of the day for a data scientist is spent cleaning data. I have confidence that my university program will teach me about the
                            algorithms and the math behind it, but I do not have the same confidence that I will learn about data engineering.
                        </p>
                        <p>Right now, my plan is to take the <a href="https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/ibm-data-engineer">IBM data engineering course</a>. 
                        Looking at the classes it offers, I feel that my understanding of data engineering will grow and it is something I am interested in. My goal would be
                        to write at least once a week about the things I am learning in that course. This will help me remember the things I am learning, but also 
                        force me to better understand the material if I am to put it into writing.</p>

                        <h4>My Goals</h4>
                        <p>With this in mind, I wanted to go over my goals for the summer and the plans I have set for them. I want to put this out 
                            there for the world to see and to hopefully hold me accountable. I am sure that some of these goals and plans will be altered as
                            time goes on, but I still want to do this.
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Learn Data Engineering</li>
                            Of course I do not mean learn data engineering in its entirety, but I want to gain a better knowledge of SQL, databases (maybe even database management),
                            data cleaning, data processing and the like. I would also like to learn more about ETL pipelines and how I can leverage them as a future data scientist.
                            <ul>
                                <li>How I am going to do this</li>
                                Like I mentioned above, I want to complete the IMB Coursera course. I would also like to have a personal project
                                where I would aquire some data, and then use my data engineering skills I am learning to create a database and do all
                                that sort of stuff.
                            </ul>
                            <li>Complete A Big Personal Project</li>
                            One idea that I have for a personal project is creating an NHL dashboard. My vision for this would be to allow the user
                            to interactively see just about any information or stat they want to about any player in any year of the NHL, or any team for any year.
                            A few weeks ago I found the NHL API that has just about anything you could want to know. However, it is all in json form 
                            (which I think is the format of all API's? Not sure, honestly) and so it is confusing for me to work with. I want to 
                            better understand this api and build my dashboard using plotly and dash.
                            <ul>
                                <li>How I am going to do this</li>
                                My plan is to currently work 4 hours a week on my project. Whether this is data scraping from the API, building a database
                                with all the information I scrape, or learning how to use dash and plotly. I want, by the end of the summer, to have
                                a working concept.
                            </ul>
                            <li>Have A Greater Involvement In The Data Science Community</li>
                            For the past two months I have been attending the <a href="https://www.meetup.com/machine-learning-utah/">MLOps Meet Up</a> here in Utah.
                            It has been a great experience and I am excited to keep attending. While I enjoy showing up
                            and then leaving, I want to play a more active role in the community in whatever
                            way that means. My plan is to reach out to the founders of the Data Science of Utah
                            meet up group and see how I can help!
                        </ul>

                    <h4>Conclusion</h4>
                    I would say that those are my main goals. Like I mentioned, I might reformulate
                    these goals and alter them as necessary, but I am excited to see where this goes!
